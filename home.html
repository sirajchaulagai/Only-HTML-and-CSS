                My career as a high-profile sommelier, wine educator and private chef was starting to wreak havoc on my health - physically, mentally, spiritually. And so I started listening to my own body. For the first time. And each intuitive choice of what to cook,
                eat and share led me to take on more healthy habits. After many requests for planning out a healthy day of cooking and eating led to a gradual shift in mindset, of my own, and those in my life, I paid attention. I honor my wellness journey
                as it evolves and want to lead others to also find clarity and direction by taking ownership of their own health.
